# CrestronSIMPLSharpSmartGraphics
Crestron SIMPLSharp Pro Smart Graphics demo program

## Synopsis

This program implements Smart Graphics in a Crestron SIMPL Sharp Pro program.
Currently the following Smart Graphics items are included:

- Standard List
- Dynamic List
- Dynamic Icon List
- Keypad
- DPad

Implemented functions are:
 - Feedback
 - Enable/Disable
 - Visibility 
 - Dynamic Text 
 - Dynamic Icons (both Analog and Serial)
 
Helper classes are included.

## Motivation

This was motivated by the lack of documentation from Crestron and the desire to promote community code sharing and framework development when there is so little provided by Crestron. 

## Installation

Copy the file into a Crestron and run the XPanel to see a running example.

## API Reference

The code is the current documentation, feel free to create some and submit a pull request. 

## Tests

Tests are not yet implemented, these are next on the todo list.
